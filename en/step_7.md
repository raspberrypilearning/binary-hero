## More custom blocks

The newest section of code is difficult to read, so you're going to use more custom blocks to make it simpler.

--- task ---
Make another block called `clear song`{:class="block3myblocks"} that deletes all items from both lists. Use this block before adding numbers back intothe lists.

When you test your code, it should work just as it did before.

So that your code is even easier to read, make another block that allows you to specify a note to be played and a time to play the note at.

Make a block that takes a number as `note`{:class="block3variables"} and a number as `time`{:class="block3variables"} and `adds`{:class="block3variables"} each number to the correct list.

This is what your code should look like:
