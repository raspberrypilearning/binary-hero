## Store your song

At the moment, notes are removed from the lists after being played, so you're left with empty lists:

You're now going to add code to store songs in your project, so that you don't have to add to your lists each time.

Make a new block called `load 'happy birthday'`{:class="block3myblocks"} that clears both the `notes`{:class="block3variables"} and `times`{:class="block3variables"} lists, and then adds the correct numbers back into both lists.

The `load 'happy birthday'`{:class="block3myblocks"} block should `delete all`{:class="block3variables"} items from both the `notes`{:class="block3variables"} and `times`{:class="block3variables"} lists and then `add`{:class="block3variables"} the correct six numbers to the list they belong in, in the correct order.

Here are the code blocks you need:

This is what your code should look like:

Test your new block by running it at the start of your project.

Each of your lists should now contain six numbers.
